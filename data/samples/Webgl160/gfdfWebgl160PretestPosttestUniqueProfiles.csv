J'ai une licence de sciences le vie et de la terre et un master d'écologie. Je ne suis pas expert en génétique, et j'ai probablement fais des erreurs dans le questionnaire... honte à moi. Cependant, je trouve le principe du jeu très intéressant ! Si on ""joue le jeu"" en s'attardant sur les phases de construction de gènes, on apprend vraiment ce qu'est la biologie de synthèse, ou du moins on comprend le principe. Petite remarque : peut-on modifier les capacité d'une bactérie de manière immédiate, comme dans le jeu, ou cela se fait-il sur plusieurs générations ?
Il serait intéressant de le préciser :)
Je vous encourage à continuer ce projet, car c'est un très bon support de médiation scientifique !",148832b8-0ab8-43c2-bdcb-8432f4e3f396,fr,posttest
