# data analysis for hero.coli

This repository contains a set of notebooks used to produce analysis to help optimize [hero.coli](http://herocoli.com/) and get new data about learning through science games. We are using row logs of activity coming from the [red metrics](https://redmetrics.io/) platform.

The main purpose is to provide a primer to perform data science with open software tools commonly used in the scientific field:

- [ipyton notebooks/jupyter]()
  - [pandas]
  - [matplotlib]
  - [scikit-learn]

## hero.coli

[Hero.coli](http://herocoli.com/) is an exploration game about synthetic biology. It uses the main concept of this scientific science and incentive players to craft/assemble biobricks to reach new steps in the main level.
